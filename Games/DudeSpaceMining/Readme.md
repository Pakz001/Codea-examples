to compile and run.
<br>
you need codea from the app store. this costs some money(not a lot though) you need a ipad or iphone(these are both expensive) I had also been testing the game on a iphone se 2020. anything above that level of performance should be good.
<br>
there are 2 graphics files that the source code. once pasted into a new codea project. you need to add 2 sprite assets. I do this by opening the gfx file inside github. then copying it into the copybuffer. with codea you can paste that into the sprite asset.
be sure to name the sprites : mytiles and uispace. do not enable the retina button in the sprite asset window. it should then be able to compile. (tested with version 0.6)

<br>
ideas : space city generator and tileset. shop and selling and building. dangerous things inside the asteroids. 
<br>
<br>
note : only 1 large asteroid gets generated. this at position apr. 100,100. The map should be infinite(64bit and memory limits)
